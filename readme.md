# cpp review
I previously only practiced c++ in hardware and robotics, so not only to get a better grasp of the language, but to learn something new, I have decided to start from the basics and learn C++. Hopefully this will help me study for a recruiters test. As it has already helped me gain a better understanding of pythons and go langs roots.
