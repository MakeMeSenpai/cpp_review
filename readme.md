I previously only practiced C/C++ in hardware and robotics, so not only to get a better grasp of the language, but to learn something new, I have decided to start from the basics and learn C/C++. Hopefully this will help me study for a recruiters test. As it has already helped me gain a better understanding of pythons and go langs roots.

That was written a while ago. Didn't get that position tho. But practice makes perfect. This is made for reference and cannot be ran.
